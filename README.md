# A Portfolio about me
### Who am i?
Hello, my name is Timmie Bang Nielsen. This program provides a brief introduction to who I am and what I have worked on during my time as a student at KEA (KÃ¸benhavns Erhvervsakademi).

### How do i run it?
It's very simple. When you open the program in your programming software (I use Visual Studio Code), open the terminal and enter **cd Portfolio**. If you are already in the correct directory, just run **python app.py**.
