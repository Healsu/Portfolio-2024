# A Portfolio about me
### Who im i?
Hello my name is Timmie Bang Nielsen and this program is just a very short
introduction of who i am and what i have worked on, during my time as a student on KEA (KÃ¸benhavns Erhversakademi) .

### How do i run it?
Very simple when opening the program on your programming software (I use Visual
Studio Code myself) use the terminal and first enter **"cd Portfolio"**. If you happen 
to already be inside it just run **"python app.py"**
